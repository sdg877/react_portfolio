      <p className="about-p">
        For twenty years, I got things done in the fast-paced worlds of TV,
        advertising, and publishing. I'm good at solving problems and leading
        teams. In 2020, I decided to try something completely different and took
        a tech A-level equivalent course with the Open University. Turns out,
        I'm pretty good at that too (95%). That sparked my interest in coding,
        and by 2023, I was diving into workshops and teaching myself the basics.
        I pick things up quickly, and I love figuring out how things work.
        <br />
        <br />
        That curiosity led me to a Software Engineering Immersive course in
        2023. I'm not afraid of a challenge, and honestly, I'm excited to be a
        woman in a field that's usually dominated by men. I'm hardworking, I'm
        driven, and I bring a bit of humour to everything I do. I'm a fast
        learner, and I'm ready to put my skills to work in a great development
        team.
        <br />
        <br />
        London is my home, but I love exploring the world. Swimming, cooking,
        and traveling keep me balanced. I've lived in Germany and Australia, and
        I'm planning trips to South Korea, Japan, and Mexico. I approach
        everything, whether it's coding or exploring a new city, with a mix of
        curiosity and a sense of fun.
