      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        With two decades of experience in administration across TV, advertising,
        and publishing, I decided it was time to take on a new challenge. During
        the 2020 lockdown, I enrolled in an access course in Maths, Science, and
        Technology with the Open University, earning a distinction (95%) and
        discovering a genuine interest in technology. Coding workshops quickly
        followed, and my passion for problem-solving led me to complete a
        Software Engineering Immersive course.
        <br />
        <br />
        Now, as a Junior Software Engineer, Iâ€™m eager to combine my analytical
        skills, adaptability, and years of experience as a team player to
        contribute to a dynamic development team.
        <br />
        <br />
        Iâ€™m a Londoner through and throughâ€”originally from West London but now
        happily settled in South London for the past seven years. I share my
        home with my boyfriend and two cats, who undoubtedly think they run the
        place. When Iâ€™m not coding, I find balance through swimming (with a good
        sauna session to top it off) and enjoy experimenting in the
        kitchenâ€”anything layered is my kind of dish. Iâ€™ve lived in Germany and
        Australia, traveled to dozens of countries, and am looking forward to
        exploring South Korea, Japan, and Mexico next.

        Some of the countries I have visited:
        <div className="flags">
          {countries.map((country, index) => (
            <span key={index} className="flag" title={country.name}>
              {country.flag}
            </span>
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
