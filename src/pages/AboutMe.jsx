      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        An experienced administrator with a diverse background across TV,
        Advertising, and Publishing industries. Driven by a passion for
        learning, I ventured into Software Engineering seeking a challenge and a
        fresh career direction. My journey began with an access course with Open
        University in Maths, Science, and Technology achieving a distinction
        (95%) amidst the 2020 lockdown. Subsequently, immersing myself in coding
        workshops allowed me to build a passion for technology and coding.
        Despite fracturing my dominant elbow during my Software Engineering
        Immersive course, I pushed through showing dedication and perseverance.
        With two decades of experience as a confident problem solver and team
        player, I am now eager to showcase my skills in a Junior Full-Stack
        Developer role to contribute to a dynamic team and continue my
        professional growth.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm a born and bred Londoner, originating from West London and made the
        (traitorous) move to South London seven years ago. I live with my
        boyfriend and two cats. I enjoy swimming as it clears my head, I love
        finishing a session off with half an hour in the sauna. I'm passionate
        about cooking and love trying out new foods, I'm a particular fan of
        layered dishes. I love travelling, having visited 10s of countries and
        lived in Germany and Australia. Although my roots are now firmly set in
        London, the next countries on my list to visit are South Korea, Japan
        and Mexico.

            </span>
          ))}
