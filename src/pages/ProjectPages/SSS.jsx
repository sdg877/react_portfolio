        For my Unit 4 project, we were required to build a full-stack web
        application using the Python-based Django Rest Framework. I am
        interested in the Environment and fast fashion so decided to build a
        clothes swap site.
        <br />
        <br />
        We were asked to build a fully CRUD website, using two data entities in
        addition to the built-in User model, ideally with one one-to-many
        relationship and one many-to-many relationship. restricted to
        authenticated users. The site must be deployed online using Railway.
        Additionally, we could allow Users to upload images AWS S3 or consume an
        API, I chose to allow users to add images of their clothes as this was
        more relevant to my site. Users must be able to Authenticate using
        Djangoâ€™s built-in system.
