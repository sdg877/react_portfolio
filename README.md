Timeframe

This project was developed over several weeks with continuous improvements and refinements. The goal was to create a fully functional, interactive, and visually appealing portfolio that showcases my development skills.


Technologies Used

React – Main framework for building the portfolio.

JavaScript – Core programming language.

HTML & CSS – Structuring and styling the portfolio.

React Router – Enables smooth navigation between pages.

Axios – Handles API requests for weather and location data.

Dotenv – Manages environment variables.

Motion – Provides smooth animations for enhanced UI experience.

React Toastify – Displays notifications for user interactions.

OpenStreetMap – Retrieves user location (if permission granted).

Open-Meteo – Fetches and displays real-time weather data.

EmailJS – Enables sending emails directly from the portfolio without backend integration.


Brief

This portfolio was designed to be fully responsive and engaging, incorporating:

A homepage with navigation buttons to access different sections.

An About Me page providing an introduction and background.

A Projects section showcasing my completed work, including live demos and GitHub repositories.

A Skills section listing my technical proficiencies.

A Contact form allowing potential employers or clients to reach out.

A Light/Dark Mode toggle that detects the user’s system preferences.

Animations throughout the portfolio to create an engaging experience.

Toast Notifications for instant feedback when submitting the contact form.

A Live Weather Widget that:

Fetches the user's location (or defaults to London if denied)
.
Displays a brief summary of the current weather.

Provides a detailed 12-hour and 7-day forecast when clicked.
