Personal Portfolio – Completed March 2025 (Updated November 2025)


Description

This portfolio was built using React to provide a clear, dynamic showcase of my projects, skills, and experience as a software developer. The goal is to offer potential employers a comprehensive understanding of my technical proficiency, design capabilities, and ability to engineer functional, user-centric web applications.

Key Features and Improvements

The portfolio is fully responsive, engaging, and incorporates continuous feature development. A major recent update includes Dynamic Project Management, where all project data is now managed in a centralised file and pulled dynamically into the UI, significantly streamlining the update process and improving data scalability. Furthermore, a customised, dynamic GitHub Contribution Graph has been integrated to display my recent commit history, providing transparent insight into my coding consistency and activity. The site's core functionality includes a Live Weather Widget that fetches the user's location (or defaults to London) and displays a detailed forecast. For improved user experience, the design features smooth animations, a Light/Dark Mode toggle with system preference detection, and instantaneous toast notifications for contact form feedback. The structure encompasses comprehensive sections for About Me, Skills, Projects (with live demos), and a fully functional Contact form, which uses EmailJS for direct communication.

Technologies Used

The application is built primarily with React and JavaScript for the core structure and UI management. Data is handled via Axios and includes integrations with OpenStreetMap and Open-Meteo for the weather feature, and GraphQL for fetching GitHub contribution data. Essential utilities include Dotenv for managing environment variables, EmailJS for the contact form functionality, and React Toastify for user notifications. The enhanced user experience is driven by Motion (Framer Motion), which provides smooth, high-performance animations and transitions throughout the site.

Code and Development Process Highlights

Development involved refactoring project data handling from static components to a dynamic, data-driven approach. This required successfully integrating three distinct third-party APIs (Open-Meteo, OpenStreetMap, GitHub) to enrich the portfolio's functionality and content. A modular component architecture was utilised in React to ensure high maintainability and code reusability. The project was developed with a mobile-first approach, guaranteeing optimal user experience across all devices. Challenges included ensuring accurate location detection and data retrieval while gracefully managing user permissions, and balancing the use of interactive elements (animations, live data) with maintaining fast load times and smooth performance. Key learnings include extensive experience in state management, efficient API integration, and best practices for creating accessible and visually engaging multi-mode UIs.

Future Improvements

I plan to expand the portfolio with a dedicated blog section documenting my development journey. I will also be implementing additional accessibility features and support for more languages, alongside further refining performance and data visualisation elements.
