Timeframe

This project was developed over several weeks with continuous improvements and refinements. The goal was to create a fully functional, interactive, and visually appealing portfolio that showcases my development skills.


Technologies Used
React – Main framework for building the portfolio.
JavaScript – Core programming language.
HTML & CSS – Structuring and styling the portfolio.
React Router – Enables smooth navigation between pages.
Axios – Handles API requests for weather and location data.
Dotenv – Manages environment variables.
Motion – Provides smooth animations for enhanced UI experience.
React Toastify – Displays notifications for user interactions.
OpenStreetMap – Retrieves user location (if permission granted).
Open-Meteo – Fetches and displays real-time weather data.
EmailJS – Enables sending emails directly from the portfolio without backend integration.


Brief
This portfolio was designed to be fully responsive and engaging, incorporating:
A homepage with navigation buttons to access different sections.
An About Me page providing an introduction and background.
A Projects section showcasing my completed work, including live demos and GitHub repositories.
A Skills section listing my technical proficiencies.
A Contact form allowing potential employers or clients to reach out.
A Light/Dark Mode toggle that detects the user’s system preferences.
Animations throughout the portfolio to create an engaging experience.
Toast Notifications for instant feedback when submitting the contact form.

A Live Weather Widget that:
